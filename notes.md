ACTIVATE ANACONDA ENVIRONMENT BY THE FOLLOWING COMMAND:

conda activate YOUR_ENV

AT THE TIME OF WRITING THIS, THERE SHOULD BE AN ENVIRONMENT CALLED handson_ml_env

THIS ENVIRONMENT I AM USING FOR THE MACHINE LEARNING TEXTBOOK CHAPTER 2
(And probably most other chapters, will probably specify here)

Copy files from one place to another
cp source destination
EX:
cp "./Chapter_2/README.md" readme.md

This command will copy the readme file in a directory one folder deeper (called Chapter_2) and copy it into the current directory you are in - and it will be name 'readme.md' instead of 'README.md'.

xdg-open "anything"
I used this to open pdfs or file explorers.
EX:
xdg-open Handson.pdf
This will open a pdf named "Handson.pdf"
